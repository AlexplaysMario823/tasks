🎵 “A Giant’s Letter to Jack” 🎵

(Verse 1) Dear Jack, my little friend, It’s been eons since that beanstalk climb, When you, a daring lad, scaled my realm, And I, the Giant, danced with time.

The clouds whispered secrets, dew-kissed, As we played hide-and-seek among the stars, Your laughter echoed through the giant’s halls, And I, too, forgot my ancient scars.

(Chorus) Jack, oh Jack, those days of wonder, When you stole my golden goose, so sly, We feasted on dreams and moonlight, And the world felt small, just you and I.

(Verse 2) Remember the harp, its strings alive? You plucked melodies, and I swayed, The castle trembled, walls of moss, As we waltzed through nights and days.

Your courage, a pebble in my giant shoe, Yet you danced with giants, unafraid, I taught you riddles, you unraveled my heart, And in your eyes, a universe was laid.

(Chorus) Jack, oh Jack, those days of wonder, When you stole my golden goose, so sly, We feasted on dreams and moonlight, And the world felt small, just you and I.

(Bridge) The giant’s heart, a cavern of memories, Of beanstalks, giants, and skies so blue, You tugged at my roots, a sprout of friendship, And I, the ancient one, reveled in you.

(Verse 3) Now, my bones creak like ancient oaks, The beanstalk long gone, its magic faded, But Jack, my dear friend, hear my song, For nostalgia blooms where memories are braided.

The goose lays no more golden eggs, The harp’s strings frayed, its notes dispersed, Yet in this letter, inked with stardust, I send you love, my Jack, across the universe.

(Chorus) Jack, oh Jack, those days of wonder, When you stole my golden goose, so sly, We feasted on dreams and moonlight, And the world felt small, just you and I.

(Outro) So here it is, my farewell ode, To beanstalks climbed and giants danced, May your days be filled with magic still, And remember, Jack, we once took a chance.

🎵 “Shere Khan’s Lament” 🎵

(Verse 1) In the jungle’s shadowed heart, I prowl, A tiger, fierce and ancient, my stripes aflame, But Mowgli, oh Mowgli, you haunt my dreams, A boy who dances with wolves, defying my name.

(Chorus) “Mowgli,” I growl, my hatred a wildfire, Your scent lingers in the tangled vines, You, the man-cub, the Law of the Jungle’s enigma, And I, Shere Khan, tremble in your moonlit signs.

(Verse 2) I remember the night we first crossed paths, Your eyes wide, innocence wrapped in fur, I, the predator, feared your defiance, Yet your courage, Mowgli, made my heart stir.

You mocked my stripes, my regal stride, Called me “coward,” “tyrant,” and more, But deep within, I knew the truth: You were the danger, the one I abhor.

(Chorus) “Mowgli,” I growl, my hatred a wildfire, Your scent lingers in the tangled vines, You, the man-cub, the Law of the Jungle’s enigma, And I, Shere Khan, tremble in your moonlit signs.

(Bridge) Fear, yes, fear gnawed at my feline soul, For you were no ordinary prey, no mere game, Your eyes held secrets, ancient whispers, And I, the mighty tiger, quivered in your name.

(Verse 3) I chased you through moon-kissed leaves, Your laughter echoing, taunting my rage, But Mowgli, my nemesis, you danced on air, And I, the hunter, stumbled in your cage.

Your wolf brothers shielded you, fierce and loyal, Baloo, Bagheera, their eyes aflame, They taught you the Law, the balance of life, While I, Shere Khan, burned with a different flame.

(Chorus) “Mowgli,” I growl, my hatred a wildfire, Your scent lingers in the tangled vines, You, the man-cub, the Law of the Jungle’s enigma, And I, Shere Khan, tremble in your moonlit signs.

(Outro) Now, as the moon wanes, and shadows lengthen, I pen this lament, my claws etching the earth, Mowgli, my adversary, my primal fear, May the jungle decide our fates, for what it’s worth.

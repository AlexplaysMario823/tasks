# "Friendship's Reprise"

(Verse 1)
In the Mushroom Kingdom, where stars align,
Wario gazes at the past, a wistful sign.
He and Mario, once comrades in play,
Shared adventures under skies of day.

But envy crept into Wario's heart,
Fame's allure tearing their bond apart.
He yearned for the spotlight, the hero's cheer,
And in that hunger, their friendship veered.

(Chorus)
**Friendship's reprise**, a melody unsung,
Wario seeks forgiveness, the ties unstrung.
Through warp pipes and castles, he roams the land,
To mend what's broken, to grasp Mario's hand.

(Verse 2)
He crafts garlic potions, coins in his sack,
A treasure trove of memories he wants back.
Luigi, the bridge between kin and kin,
Caught in the crossfire, torn from within.

Wario's mustache twitches, eyes filled with strife,
As he plots a reunion, a chance at life.
He'll bake garlic bread, brew mushroom tea,
To bridge the gap, to set their spirits free.

(Chorus)
**Friendship's reprise**, a melody unsung,
Wario seeks forgiveness, the ties unstrung.
Through warp pipes and castles, he roams the land,
To mend what's broken, to grasp Mario's hand.

(Bridge)
In the haunted mansion's eerie glow,
Wario whispers secrets only ghosts know.
He'll challenge Mario to kart races anew,
And maybe, just maybe, their bond will renew.

But ghosts laugh softly, cryptic and wise,
For friendship's magic isn't won with lies.
Wario must learn, beyond rivalry's haze,
That love and laughter light up darker days.

(Chorus)
**Friendship's reprise**, a melody unsung,
Wario seeks forgiveness, the ties unstrung.
Through warp pipes and castles, he roams the land,
To mend what's broken, to grasp Mario's hand.

(Outro)
As star bits twinkle in the midnight sky,
Wario dreams of laughter, of days gone by.
He'll chase rainbows, ride Yoshi's back,
To find forgiveness, to mend the crack.

And when the final note echoes through the air,
Will Mario listen? Will he truly care?
**Friendship's reprise**, a chance to amend,
Wario's heart beats, hoping for a friend.

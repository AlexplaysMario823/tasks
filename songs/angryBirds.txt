🎵 “Pigs’ Lament: The Angry Birds” 🎵

(Verse 1) In the green-hued valleys of Piggy Isle, Where snouts snuffled and mischief brewed, The pigs oinked merrily, their plots afoot, But little did they know, a feud would intrude.

Red Bird and his feathered crew soared high, Their beaks sharp, their eyes ablaze, They saw the swine’s thievery, eggs pilfered, And in their hearts, a righteous fire blazed.

(Chorus) “Pigs are terrorists!” Red Bird squawked, Their snorts and grunts, a nefarious plot, The stolen eggs, not mere yolks, but souls, And so began the avian-porcine onslaught.

(Verse 2) The pigs, rotund and unsuspecting, Built their flimsy structures, blissfully unaware, But Red Bird sharpened his beak, his friends rallied, For justice, they’d fight, the skies they’d tear.

The King Pig, crown askew, trembled, His castle of sticks and straw quivered, “Call them terrorists,” he snorted, “but we’re hungry!” As Red Bird dive-bombed, feathers shivered.

(Chorus) “Pigs are terrorists!” Red Bird squawked, Their snorts and grunts, a nefarious plot, The stolen eggs, not mere yolks, but souls, And so began the avian-porcine onslaught.

(Bridge) The Black Bird, explosive temper simmering, Bombed the piggy forts, debris flying, Chuck spun like a tornado, feathers whirling, And the pigs squealed, their fate defying.

(Verse 3) The Blues split into three, a trifecta of rage, Darting through the air, like vengeful sprites, The pigs’ structures crumbled, sticks and stones, As Red Bird led the charge, day into night.

“Pigs are terrorists!” echoed across the isle, Matilda’s eggs safe, Bomb’s fury unbridled, Terence, silent but deadly, crushed the last fort, And the pigs, bewildered, their snouts stifled.

(Chorus) “Pigs are terrorists!” Red Bird squawked, Their snorts and grunts, a nefarious plot, The stolen eggs, not mere yolks, but souls, And so began the avian-porcine onslaught.

(Outro) The pigs surrendered, their snouts in the mud, Their structures toppled, their mischief undone, Red Bird perched on a twig, feathers ruffled, And the sun dipped low, victory finally won.

🎵 “Pigs’ Lament: The Angry Birds” 🎵

In the clash of beaks and snouts, where feathers met snorts, a tale of eggs, revenge, and airborne justice unfolded. And somewhere, the pigs grunted, “Maybe we should’ve stuck to bacon.” 🐷🐦🥚

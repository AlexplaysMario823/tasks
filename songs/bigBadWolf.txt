🎵 “The Ballad of the Grizzled Wolf” 🎵

(Verse 1) In the twilight of my lupine years, I sit by the fire, whiskers gray, A tale to tell, a truth to reveal, Of huffs, puffs, and a bygone day.

Once upon a time, in straw and sticks, Three little pigs danced, carefree and spry, Their snouts in the air, their tails a-twirl, And I, the Big Bad Wolf, watched from nearby.

(Chorus) “Chasing pigs?” I scoffed, my voice gravelly, “More like a game, a dance of fate, They built flimsy houses, taunting me, And so, my dear friends, I took the bait.”

(Verse 2) The first pig, Fiddler, played his tune, His straw abode swayed in the breeze, “Come, Wolf,” he grinned, “test your might!” And I obliged, for hunger had its fees.

The second, Fifer, blew his reed, His stick house sturdy, defiance in his eyes, “Blow, Wolf,” he dared, “blow with all your might!” And so I huffed, my breath a tempest of surprise.

(Chorus) “Chasing pigs?” I scoffed, my voice gravelly, “More like a game, a dance of fate, They built flimsy houses, taunting me, And so, my dear friends, I took the bait.”

(Bridge) But the third pig, oh, that clever swine, Brick by brick, he labored in the sun, His house stood firm, defiance etched in mortar, And I, the Wolf, wondered what I’d done.

(Verse 3) “Three little pigs,” I muttered, teeth bared, Their laughter echoed through the glen, I huffed, I puffed, but that brick abode, It held its ground, a fortress against my sin.

“Antagonist,” they called me, “villainous fiend,” Yet hunger gnawed, my belly hollow, I chased them not for malice, but survival, A primal dance, fate’s cruel waltz to follow.

(Chorus) “Chasing pigs?” I scoffed, my voice gravelly, “More like a game, a dance of fate, They built flimsy houses, taunting me, And so, my dear friends, I took the bait.”

(Outro) Now, as the hearth crackles, memories flicker, I wonder if they remember our chase, Three little pigs, and one old wolf, Caught in life’s whimsical, carnivorous embrace.

And so, my friends, judge me not harshly. For hunger knows no morality, and sometimes, even wolves yearn for redemption. 🌕🐺🎶

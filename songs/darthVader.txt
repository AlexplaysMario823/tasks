# "Vengeance's Embrace"

(Verse 1)
In the shadows of a galaxy torn,
Darth Vader broods, his heart forlorn.
A mask conceals his twisted face,
As memories of loss leave no trace.

The Force whispers secrets in his ear,
Echoes of betrayal, pain, and fear.
Once a Jedi knight, now a Sith lord,
He craves retribution, unsheathes his sword.

(Chorus)
**Vengeance's embrace**, a burning fire,
Fueling his rage, his deepest desire.
Against the stars, he'll carve his fate,
Darth Vader rises, consumed by hate.

(Verse 2)
He hunts down rebels, their hope undone,
Their defiance a challenge, a war unwon.
Through starlit voids and crimson skies,
He seeks redemption in their demise.

His breath, mechanical, rasps like a storm,
A symphony of wrath, a requiem warm.
The fallen Jedi, once Anakin's name,
Now wields the dark side, a tempest aflame.

(Chorus)
**Vengeance's embrace**, a burning fire,
Fueling his rage, his deepest desire.
Against the stars, he'll carve his fate,
Darth Vader rises, consumed by hate.

(Bridge)
The ghost of Padm√© haunts his dreams,
Her love, her loss, like spectral beams.
Obi-Wan's betrayal, etched in scars,
Anakin Skywalker, fallen among the stars.

He marches on, a blackened tide,
Across desolate planets, where hope has died.
His lightsaber hums, crimson and cruel,
A symphony of vengeance, a cosmic duel.

(Chorus)
**Vengeance's embrace**, a burning fire,
Fueling his rage, his deepest desire.
Against the stars, he'll carve his fate,
Darth Vader rises, consumed by hate.

(Outro)
In the void, he stands, a tragic refrain,
A fallen hero, bound by chains.
The galaxy trembles, caught in his grip,
Darth Vader's revenge, an eternal eclipse.

🎵 “The Foxy Ballad of the Gingerbread Man” 🎵

(Verse 1) In a meadow green, where the sun did shine, Lived a gingerbread man, sweet and fine. His doughy heart beat with sugary glee, But the fox nearby had a different decree.

(Pre-Chorus) The fox, sly and cunning, with eyes so keen, Watched the gingerbread man, his golden sheen. He licked his lips, hunger in his gaze, Plotting mischief, weaving a wicked maze.

(Chorus) Oh, gingerbread man, heed my advice, Don’t trust the fox, for he’s full of vice. He’ll whisper sweet lies, lead you astray, And call you foolish as you crumble away.

(Verse 2) The gingerbread man danced, oh so carefree, His raisin buttons twinkling, laughter in the breeze. But the fox slinked closer, his paws on the prowl, Luring the cookie with a treacherous howl.

(Pre-Chorus) “Dear gingerbread man,” the fox did say, “Why run from me? Let’s chat and play. Your legs are swift, but my wits are keen, Stay a while longer, let’s share a scene.”

(Chorus) Oh, gingerbread man, heed my advice, Don’t trust the fox, for he’s full of vice. He’ll whisper sweet lies, lead you astray, And call you foolish as you crumble away.

(Bridge) The gingerbread man hesitated, unsure, His cinnamon heart torn, emotions a blur. “Fox,” he said, “why do you mock my stride? I’m made of love and flour, not foolish pride.”

(Verse 3) The fox grinned wide, eyes glinting with greed, “Dear gingerbread man, you’re a tasty deed. Your sweetness blinds you, your trust misplaced, And now, my dear cookie, you’re perfectly laced.”

(Pre-Chorus) The gingerbread man trembled, crumbs in the air, As the fox lunged forward, hunger laid bare. But the little cookie, with courage unbowed, Leaped from the meadow, shouting aloud:

(Chorus) “Oh, fox, you may call me foolish and frail, But I’ll crumble with purpose, leave a sweet trail. For in my crumbling, I’ll scatter my love, And perhaps, just perhaps, I’ll rise above.”

(Outro) So, remember the tale of the gingerbread man, How he danced with defiance, defying the plan. The fox may call him foolish, but in the end, He left a trail of sweetness, a lesson to send.

🎵 “The Witch’s Lament” 🎵

(Verse 1) In a darkened forest, where shadows intertwine, Lived a wicked old witch with a twisted mind. She brewed her potions, stirred her cauldron’s brew, And whispered secrets to the moonlight’s hue.

(Pre-Chorus) Hansel and Gretel, oh, they wandered near, Innocent souls, eyes wide with fear. The witch, she cackled, her voice like a storm, “Idiots!” she spat, “You’re lost and forlorn.”

(Chorus) “Idiots,” she sang, her laughter echoing through the trees, “Lost in my maze of tricks and deceit. Hansel, Gretel, heed my wicked rhyme, Your fate is sealed; you’re running out of time.”

(Verse 2) Hansel, the fool, dropped breadcrumbs behind, Gretel, the dreamer, believed in magic signs. But the witch, oh, she knew their every move, Her eyes glinting with malice, her heart removed.

(Pre-Chorus) “Idiots,” she hissed, her fingers gnarled and cold, “You think you’re clever? You’re merely fools, behold! The gingerbread house, a sweet trap I’ve laid, Soon you’ll be my feast, your innocence betrayed.”

(Chorus) “Idiots,” she sang, her laughter echoing through the trees, “Lost in my maze of tricks and deceit. Hansel, Gretel, heed my wicked rhyme, Your fate is sealed; you’re running out of time.”

(Bridge) But Hansel, brave Hansel, whispered to his sister, “Gretel, we’ll outwit her, break free from this blister.” They gathered courage, hearts intertwined, Against the witch’s darkness, their light would shine.

(Chorus) “Idiots,” she sang, her laughter echoing through the trees, “Lost in my maze of tricks and deceit. Hansel, Gretel, heed my wicked rhyme, Your fate is sealed; you’re running out of time.”

(Outro) Yet love and cunning prevailed that fateful night, As Hansel and Gretel turned the tables with might. The witch, defeated, her power now undone, In their bravery, they found freedom under the sun.

So remember, dear wanderers, when shadows grow long, Beware the witch’s whispers, her twisted song. For even in darkness, courage can ignite, And idiots become heroes in the moon’s soft light. 🌙✨

🎵 “Mario’s Melody for Bezos” 🎵

(Verse 1) In the Mushroom Kingdom, where pipes twist and turn, Mario donned his cap, his mustache a burn, He leaped through the pixels, a plumber so bold, But little did he know, a tale would unfold.

(Chorus) “Hey, Bezos!” Mario shouted with glee, “Your billions don’t impress me, you see, You’re just a pixelated coin collector, But in the real world, you’re a poor sector!”

(Verse 2) Bezos, in his tower of Amazon might, Counted stacks of gold, day and night, His Prime empire stretched across the globe, Yet Mario scoffed, his tone full of probe.

“Your drones deliver packages, that’s true, But my warp pipes? They take me to the moon! You may have warehouses, vast and grand, But my warp zones? They defy the land!”

(Chorus) “Hey, Bezos!” Mario shouted with glee, “Your billions don’t impress me, you see, You’re just a pixelated coin collector, But in the real world, you’re a poor sector!”

(Bridge) Bezos frowned, adjusting his monocle, His bald head gleaming like a shiny shell, “Mario,” he retorted, “you’re a relic of the past, I’ve got rockets to Mars, my wealth unsurpassed!”

(Verse 3) But Mario twirled, his red cap spinning, “Bezos, my friend, your riches are thinning, For in the warp pipe of life, what truly matters? Not dollars, but mushrooms, stars, and clattering platters.”

(Chorus) “Hey, Bezos!” Mario shouted with glee, “Your billions don’t impress me, you see, You’re just a pixelated coin collector, But in the real world, you’re a poor sector!”

(Outro) And so, the battle raged on, pixel versus prime, Mario’s fireballs against Bezos’s climb, But in the end, it wasn’t wealth that won, It was the joy of jumping, the thrill of the run.

In the warp zone of creativity, where lyrics collide with reality, Mario sang his truth to the skies. And somewhere, Jeff Bezos pondered, perhaps even smiled. 🍄💫

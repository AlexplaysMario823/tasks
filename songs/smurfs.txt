🎵 “Curse the Smurfs” 🎵

(Verse 1) In the dark of the forest, where shadows creep, Lives a sorcerer twisted, his secrets deep. Gargamel, they call me, with vengeance aflame, My heart black as night, my soul bound in shame.

(Pre-Chorus) The Smurfs, those wretched creatures, so small and blue, They dance in their village, their laughter untrue. But I, Gargamel, curse their very existence, For they thwart my plans with relentless persistence.

(Chorus) Oh, Smurfs, you’ll pay for this, mark my words, Your mushroom houses, your joyous herds. I’ll brew potions of doom, cast spells of despair, And in the moon’s pale glow, I’ll haunt your lair.

(Verse 2) Papa Smurf, their leader, with wisdom and might, He thwarts my enchantments, dispels my blight. Clumsy, Brainy, and Smurfette, a trifling crew, But together they stand, their loyalty true.

(Pre-Chorus) “Gargamel,” they mock, “your schemes are in vain, Your cat Azrael, useless, your potions insane.” But I’ll show them, oh yes, with a wicked grin, My wrath shall descend, their downfall begin.

(Chorus) Oh, Smurfs, you’ll pay for this, mark my words, Your mushroom houses, your joyous herds. I’ll brew potions of doom, cast spells of despair, And in the moon’s pale glow, I’ll haunt your lair.

(Bridge) Azrael, my faithful feline, claws sharpened and keen, We’ll hunt them down, those Smurfs, so obscene. From the depths of my cauldron, a curse shall arise, To darken their days, extinguish their skies.

(Verse 3) “Gargamel,” they’ll cry, as their village crumbles, “Why curse us so? What have we done to stumble?” But I’ll laugh, oh how I’ll laugh, as their hope fades, For vengeance is sweet, and their fate is laid.

(Chorus) Oh, Smurfs, you’ll pay for this, mark my words, Your mushroom houses, your joyous herds. I’ll brew potions of doom, cast spells of despair, And in the moon’s pale glow, I’ll haunt your lair.

(Outro) So dance, little Smurfs, in your forest glade, But know that Gargamel’s wrath will never fade. The night whispers secrets, and the stars align, Curse upon curse, until the end of time.
